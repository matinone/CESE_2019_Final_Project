### Note
_Espressif IoT Development Framework_ (ESP-IDF), the official development framework for the ESP32 chip, is not part of the project. As the documentation states: 
> Instead it is standalone, and linked to the project via the IDF_PATH environment variable which holds the path of the esp-idf directory. This allows the IDF framework to be decoupled from your project.
